# WebGL_basics
A flying helicopter and a walking robot in a 3D scene implemented with WebGL

### Brief explaination of differences in 3 projects.
- Project A is 2D implementation of two jointed moving models - a walking robot and a flying helicopter.
- Project B is putting things in Project A in a 3D scene. And added different view perspectives and adjustable positions.
- Project C added light effects, different materials and simple texture mapping.

### Usage:
- For most scenes, you donnot need to install anything. Open the HTML file with Google Chrome and you may see the projects.
- For texture mapping in proj C, you need to use local chrome web broswer or build a local server to see it.

### Control bar:
The control bar is implemented using Dat.GUI, it's a lightweight controller library for JavaScript. (https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui/blob/master/API.md)
